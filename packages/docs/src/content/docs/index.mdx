<Card icon="approve-check" title="A Linter for Packages">
  **midnight-smoker** is like a _linter for your published packages_. It ships
  with built-in configurable _rules_ which check for common issues and
  misconfigurations. _These are the nasties your unit and integration tests
  can't catch._
</Card>
<Card title="Custom Tests" icon="setting">
  Run custom scripts against your package _as a consumer would install it_. Go
  where static analysis can't take you. _Then go further_. ☮️
</Card>
<Card title="Monorepos Welcome" icon="list-format">
  **midnight-smoker** was written with monorepos and workspaces in mind. Use it
  with _specific_ workspaces, _all_ of your workspaces or _no_ workspaces.
</Card>
<Card title="Pluggable" icon="puzzle">
  **midnight-smoker** has first-class plugin support. Want a new rule? How about
  several? Got a new package manager? Or XML reporter (I'm sorry)? [Write your
  own plugin](/developer/plugin-overview) and share it.
</Card>

</CardGrid>

<Card title="World Famous Package Manager Test Matrix" icon="random">
Ever wished you could easily check compatibility with a specific version of a specific package manager?  No? OK, fine—but some of us have, anyway.

You can use **midnight-smoker** and assert your target package manager installs your package properly. Or your target package manager's _last two major versions_. Or this package manager and that other one (but the old version--you know, the one everyone still uses). Or _all_ versions of all package managers, I guess?
