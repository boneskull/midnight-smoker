## Installation

If you're here, you probably don't need to know how to install it, but I feel like I'm supposed to write this anyway?

It's recommended to install `midnight-smoker` as a dev dependency:

```shell title="Installing midnight-smoker"
npm install midnight-smoker --save-dev
```

## Basic Usage

To run **midnight-smoker**'s builtin checks against your project, run the following command:

```shell title="Run midnight-smoker"
npx midnight-smoker
```

Assuming your package isn't all jacked up, you should see output akin to:

```text title="midnight-smoker happy path output"
