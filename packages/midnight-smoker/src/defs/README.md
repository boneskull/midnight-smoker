# `midnight-smoker/defs`: Core Types for Plugins

This directory contains the types of _components_; a plugin is a collection of components. Plugin authors will find these types helpful.

Note that this directory should not contain any Zod schemas! The schemas are not public use, and should be considered an implementation detail.
