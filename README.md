# ðŸ’¨ midnight-smoker

> Run smoke tests against packages as they would be published

## Motivation

This thing helps prevent you from publishing something which passes all the tests, but is misconfigured or fails when a consumer tries to install or run it.

Examples of things that would be a problem:

- Missing files in published package
- `devDepenencies` which should be `dependencies`
- Weirdo `exports` configuration
- Wonky lifecycle scripts

`midnight-smoker` is intended to run in CI or in a pre-publish lifecycle script.

## Example Usage

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```bash
npx midnight-smoker test:smoke # runs npm script "test:smoke"
ðŸ’¨ midnight-smoker v1.0.0
âœ” Found npm at /wherever/npm/lives/bin/npm
âœ” Packed 1 package
âœ” Installed 1 package
âœ” Successfully ran 1 script
âœ” Lovey-dovey! ðŸ’–
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

`midnight-smoker` is compatible with npm workspaces and stuff.

## What It Does

Three (3) things:

1. It runs `npm pack` on the package(s)
2. Installs the resulting tarball(s) to a temp dir (or dir of your choosing) using [`--install-strategy=shallow`/`--global-style`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/config#install-strategy) to avoid hoisting/deduping. This will install _only_ "production" dependencies.
3. For each package, executes `npm run <script>` with `/some/tmp/dir/node_modules/<package>` as the current working directory

This means whatever script gets run will _not_ have access to your testing framework, linter, etc.

## Usage

Depending on your setup, one of these should work:

### For Single-Package Repos

Add two scripts to your `package.json`. The first script will run `smoker <second-script>`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:smoke": "smoker smoke",
    "smoke": "node ./some-script.js"
  }
}
```

### For Repos Using npm Workspaces

Add a script to your **root** `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:smoke": "smoker --all smoke"
  }
}
```

The `--all` flag tells `midnight-smoker` to run the `smoke` script in all workspaces. For each workspace, add a `smoke` script, changing the behavior as needed:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "smoke": "node ./some-script.js"
  }
}
```

### Try It

Feeling lucky? Run `npm run test:smoke`.

**Run `npx midnight-smoker --help`** to see more options.

> Note: You can name your scripts whatever you want; there is nothing special about `smoke` or `test:smoke`.

### Waitâ€”What Should My Script Do?

In many cases, executing the package's entry point is sufficient:

```json
{
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test:smoke": "smoker run-entry-point",
    "run-entry-point": "node ."
  }
}
```

Otherwise:

- If your package distributes an executable, you might want to run that instead, and give it some common arguments (assuming it depends on your entry point). _Or_ you could go BUCK WILD and run it a bunch of different ways.
- If your package is lazy-loading its dependencies--like if you have a `require()` or `await import()` within some function that isn't called at startup--you may need to do more work than this.

**If you find yourself needing a dev tool to run your script, you are missing the point.** Again: you want to load/run your package as a consumer would--that means _running your distfiles_ **without** dev deps.

That's it. That's the project.

## Installation

Run `npm install midnight-smoker --save-dev`.

- Minimum Node.js versions supported: `^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0`
- Minimum `npm` version supported: `v7.0.0`

  > I recommend adding `midnight-smoker` as a dev dep, but the above action is just a wrapper around `midnight-smoker`.

That song sucks.
